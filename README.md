# Biosignal Control for Unity3D Surgical Traning Platform

## Introduction
This project provides a bio-signalâ€“driven control system integrated into a Unity3D-based surgical training platform. The system enables real-time analysis of user cognitive and physiological states, providing insights into performance, stress, and learning outcomes in surgical skill training.

## Features

### Bio-signal Data Range Calibration & Real-time Collection
EEG (attention, stress) - Cortex API connect

HRV (RMSSD) - bluetooth connect

Action events (move / stop detection)

Unity3D condition (mode) control - UDP transfer
### Python Data Analysis
Performance Metrics : MAE, completion time, pause counts, etc.

Biosignal Integration: Aligns EEG and HRV data with trajectory timelines to study attention, stress, and physiological responses.

Visualization: Generates table and diagrams to compare and evaluate results.

## Equipments
HRV : [POLAR H10 chest band](https://www.polar.com/uk-en/sensors/h10-heart-rate-sensor)

EEG : [EMOTIV MN8 earphone](https://www.emotiv.com/products/mn8)
